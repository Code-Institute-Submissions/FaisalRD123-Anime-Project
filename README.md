Design

Design Choices
The website is designed in such a way to make users feel excited and pump. Almost all the buttons have hover effect and quite some animations especially about fights as it is the most popular anime genre.

Colour
The colour scheme for my site is mostly bright but calm at the same time to give a kinda Yin/Yang feeling as anime is mostly loved for its fights and colorful personalities.
The color are chosen from mostly cooler color contrast as it has a wide range of colors available.
