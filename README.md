Design

Design Choices
The website is designed in such a way to make users feel excited and pump. Almost all the buttons have hover effect and quite some animations especially about fights as it is the most popular anime genre.

Colour
The colour scheme for my site is mostly bright but calm at the same time to give a kinda Yin/Yang feeling as anime is mostly loved for its fights and colorful personalities.
The color are chosen from mostly cooler color contrast as it has a wide range of colors available.

 

Fonts
Mostly, 'Grapenuts' font is used for the site. It is taken from google font.

Structure of the site
The structure of my site is very easy to follow, creative and user friendly.
* The main page consists of three main sections; header (includes link to other pages), body (anime videos) and footer (social media links).
* A sign up page with a sign up form with hovering effect.
* Contact us page that includes my personal contact details and a little about myself.
* About us that includes about the site and our motivation.

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
•	In the GitHub repository, go to the Settings tab.
•	In the Generals section, go to Pages.
•	Source: deploy from branch. The branch should be main and folder was root.
•	Go to codes, on the right side, click GitHub-pages.

Future Work
For the future work, a lot of new animes can be added to the site. For now, there are only 6 while hundreds of thousands are available on the internet that can be deployed on this site. Also, for the manga lovers, a manga page can be created where a lot of manga can be deployed for the users to enjoy. 
Animations made the website quite slow. Better implementation of animations will work wonders on the site.
